# Order-to-Cash Data Warehouse

## Overview

This project implements a modern **Data Warehouse for Order-to-Cash (O2C) analytics**, integrating operational data from multiple enterprise systems including SAP ERP, Odoo CRM, and internal logistics systems.

The objective of this platform is to provide a **single source of truth for commercial and financial analytics**, enabling the business to analyze the complete lifecycle of a customer order — from order creation to invoicing, payment, and credit adjustments.

The solution follows a **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Analytics → Gold)** to ensure data quality, scalability, and maintainability.

Data is ingested from operational systems, standardized and cleansed in intermediate layers, and finally modeled into a **Star Schema optimized for BI tools such as Power BI**.

The final Gold layer exposes **business-ready fact and dimension tables**, enabling fast and reliable reporting for finance, sales, and operations teams.

# Architecture

The project follows a **Medallion Architecture**, a layered data design pattern widely used in modern data platforms.

Each layer progressively improves data quality and structure.

(star schema for BI)
```

1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# Data Sources

The data warehouse integrates information from multiple operational systems.

| System   | Description                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SAP ERP  | Financial data including invoices, payments, and accounting documents |
| Odoo CRM | Customer master data and commercial relationships                     |
| CIOSACOM | Internal operational system for order and logistics management        |

These systems provide data required to analyze the **complete Order-to-Cash lifecycle**.

# Star Schema

The Gold layer implements a dimensional model optimized for analytics.

![Star Schema](docs/star_schema.drawio.png)

### Fact Tables

* `fact_pedidos`
* `fact_facturas`
* `fact_pagos`
* `fact_aplicaciones_pago`
* `fact_notas_credito`
* `fact_pedidos_pool`

### Dimension Tables

* `dim_cliente`
* `dim_empleado`
* `dim_estatus_factura`
* `dim_estatus_pool`
* `dim_motivo_pool`
* `dim_usuario_libero`
* `dim_paqueteria`

### Bridge Tables

* `bridge_interlocutores`

This bridge table tracks the historical relationship between customers and employees using **Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD2)** logic.

# ETL Pipeline

The ETL process is implemented using SQL stored procedures and runs in the following order:

1. Load Bronze layer (raw ingestion)
2. Load Silver layer (data cleansing)
3. Load Analytics layer (historical modeling)
4. Expose Gold layer views for reporting
